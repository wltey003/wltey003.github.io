##### Hi! I'm really lost but I am trying my best. So erm, I wasn't supposed to be late today, I tried to be on time but :(
##### I will try to git out of my house faster next time.

###### Here are 3 things what I wish for ICT239:
1. I can pass
2. I can make a super cool page
3. I can earn money after this
